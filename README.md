## The Scripts for Geomatics Engineering Lessons
These are codes for Geomatics Engineering Lessons. The lessons at Yıldız Technical University were based on while the codes were written.

### Requirements
The codes run with all the python versions.

* MicroPython is necessary for the calculator.


### Loading MicroPython and Codes to the Calculators
The codes were run by loading in Casio FX-9860G. But the Python programming language is not found as default in this calculator. Therefore, loading Python is necessary for calculators in similar situations such as this.

MicroPython and codes were loaded to the calculator through the Casio FA-124 application that was used for the Casio FX-9860G series.   

### Information
All the directories in the <a href="https://github.com/ynsemrevrl/Geomatics-Engineering-Lessons/tree/main/codes">`codes`</a> represent lessons. There are codes that belong to related lessons in each directory.
